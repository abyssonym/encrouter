Here is a variation designed to route out the Rhinotaur/Rhodox encounter. The encounter is skipped before Lete and an extra encounter is fought on the way to the Imperial Base, so the overall number of encounters is the same. The significant tradeoffs are roughly:
Rhinotaur/Rhodox x2 <-> Beakor/Rhobite x2
Ghost x3/Poplium x2 <-> Ghost/Poplium x2 (better)
Hazer x3/Whisper    <-> StillGoing x3 (gained the potential to pincer)
Hazer x1/Whisper x2 <-> Whisper x4 (worse)
Rhinotaur/Rhodox x2 <-> Tusker x2 (veldt, probably better)
